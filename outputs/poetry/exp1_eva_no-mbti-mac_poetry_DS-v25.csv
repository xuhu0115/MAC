Both lines discuss the themes of inner peace and purification, with '定' (calming) and '静' (stillness) forming a logical progression.

However, while the lines sound pleasant together, they do not strictly follow traditional tonal or rhyming rules, which slightly detracts from the overall musicality. The flow is generally good, but could be enhanced with a more deliberate tonal match.""
